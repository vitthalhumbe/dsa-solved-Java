# 1732. Find the Highest Altitude
There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of n + 1 points at different altitudes. The biker starts his trip on point 0 with altitude equal 0.

You are given an integer array gain of length n where gain[i] is the net gain in altitude between points i​​​​​​ and i + 1 for all (0 <= i < n). Return the highest altitude of a point.


 # my code (yes it's my)
 ```java
class Solution {
    public int largestAltitude(int[] gain) {
        int n = gain.length;
        int[] arr = new int[n + 1];
        arr[0] = 0;
        int max = arr[0];
        for (int i = 1; i<= n; i++) {
            arr[i] = gain[i - 1] + arr[i - 1];
            if (arr[i] > max) max = arr[i];
        }

        return max;
    }
}
```
