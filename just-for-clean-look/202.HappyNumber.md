# 202. Happy Number
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

    Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
    Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
    Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.

Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

# my code (accidently got O(log N) solution )
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isHappy(int n) {
        if (n == 1 || n==7) return true;
        long  sum = 0;
        while (n > 9) {
            sum = 0;
            long og = n;
            while (og != 0) {
                long rem = og % 10;
                og =(long) og / 10;
                sum += rem * rem;
            }
            n =(int) sum;
        }

        return (sum==1 || sum== 7) ? true : false;
    }
}
```
