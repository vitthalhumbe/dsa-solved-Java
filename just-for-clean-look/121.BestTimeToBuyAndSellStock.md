Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.


# my code (community help)
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int cheap = prices[0];
        int maxProfit = 0;
        int n = prices.length;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (prices[i] > cheap) {
                int profit = prices[i] - cheap;
                maxProfit = Math.max(profit, maxProfit);
            } else {
                cheap = prices[i];
            }
        }   

        return maxProfit;
    }
}
```
