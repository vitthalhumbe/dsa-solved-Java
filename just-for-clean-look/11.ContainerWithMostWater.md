# 11. Container with Most Water

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.


### Example :
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]

Output: 49

Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

## Code (AlgoMasterIO yt) :
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
        int maxArea = 0;

        while (left <= right) {
            int width = right - left;
            int minHeight = Math.min(height[left], height[right]);
            int area = width * minHeight;

            maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, area);

            if (height[left] < height[right]) {
                left ++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }
        return maxArea;
    }
}
```
