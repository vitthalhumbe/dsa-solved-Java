# 151. Reverse words in a string
Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.


## My code 
```java
class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String array[]  = s.trim().split("\\s+");

        for (int i = array.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            sb.append(array[i]);
            sb.append(" ");
        }

        return sb.toString().trim();
    }
}
```
